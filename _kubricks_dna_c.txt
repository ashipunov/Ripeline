# "dna" is the local "DNA database"
# variables are:
SOURCE	where from, "MISU" is for sequences obtained locally ("ours"), "OTHERS" could be from GenBank, BOLD or elsewhere
SEQUENCE.ID.ORIG	typically forms like "LETTER_SHORTCUT-NUMBER"; if two samples have same sequences, IDs concatenated with comma
SEQUENCE.ID	sometimes, it is reasonable to modify the original ID (e.g., to simplify concatenation)
FRAGMENT	code of the fragment, this project has "abcd" and "efgh" DNA fragments
SPECIES.NEW	see the "samples" table
COMMENT	comment
SELECT	which sequences to use
SEQUENCE	actual DNA string, "ATGCN" are allowed letters
